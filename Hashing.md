## What is Hashing?

Hashing is a method used to permanently transform data into a fixed-length output, usually meant for sensitive information such as passwords, messages, and documents.
(* Please note, the term encryption simply means the act of hiding a secret message which can be decoded, while hashing is irreversible)

## How does it work?
Hashing works by converting data into these fixed-length strings, or hash values, by using a special algorithm called a hash function.

- The same input always produces the same hash
- Even a tiny change in input creates a completely different hash
- Hashes cannot be reversed back into the original data
